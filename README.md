## Inspiration ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
When we book a room usually we take the reference of the pictures shown on the website to know how good the room is, and that sometimes doesn't meet our expectations.

## What it does ðŸš€ ðŸš€
It is a live room visit web app, where we can visit a room through a video conference to check before they book.

## How we built it ðŸ’»
Dolby communication api for video conferencing, Angular for frontend, Nodejs express MongoDB are used for backend, Sawo labs api for authentication, Netlify Heroku and GH pages for deployment

## Challenges we ran into
Dolby communication api was new for us, so we faced difficulty while the deployment of the web App

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully completed the project after so many difficulties

## What we learned
We learned about different APIs and to implement them

## What's next for RoamRooms
The whole process from the hotel's side will be automated. With the help of IOT we will add a device that will show the live footage of the rooms when a meeting gets conducted.
